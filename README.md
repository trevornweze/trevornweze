# 👋 Hi there,
I’m Trevor Nweze, a Fullstack & Creative Developer with a background in Advanced Computer Science and a passion for crafting digital experiences that are as seamless as they are stunning.
I thrive where design, development, and creative technology intersect — blending code and aesthetics to build systems that scale, flow, and feel alive. From front-end design to cloud-based architecture, I love bringing ideas to life

##🧩 My focus areas:
Building interactive frontends with React, Next.js, and Angular
Architecting efficient backends with Express and cloud services
Exploring 3D, motion, and creative tech experiences on the web
Designing products that balance form, function, and emotion
When I’m not designing or coding, I’m experimenting with motion design, exploring Google Cloud & AWS, or rethinking how technology and creativity can merge.
💌 Let’s build something incredible.
